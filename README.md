## changelog
- created sanity client
- wrote data fetching script in the pages/index.tsx file
- installed react and react redux
- created store to keep data fetched from sanity
- added a parseNFTLink function to /utils/parseNFTLink.ts, to parse the link of any NFT, so it can be passed as a unique metadata link. This function accepts the NFT's index as a parameter, and simply returns a parsed link string
- created a function that allows a user switch to hedera (find it in the utils folder), on calling the wallet connection function (written in the header component)

- Added functionality for customers to receive regular testnet HBAR tokens to handle the gas fees for buying and selling.
